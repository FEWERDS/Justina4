        From childhood, I've been fascinated with art, spurred by Da Vinci's "egg" painting and various handicrafts. My curiosity expanded towards animated game characters and 3D designs, which was encouraged by joining a capacitor model car competition and utilizing a home 3D printer for personal projects. These experiences deepened my interest in innovation, especially after participating in a recycling woodwork project. Over time, I realized the complexity behind art and animations, leading me to self-learn online programming, 3D modeling, and animation, culminating in my appreciation for the fusion of art and technology.
